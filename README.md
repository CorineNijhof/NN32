# NN32

This depository contains the code for the drum beat generating MLP that was created for the course Neural Networks, given by prof. dr. Herbert Jaeger at the university of Groningen.
The input data is included in the midi_files.zip folder, and the generated drum beats are included as midi files, with the name specifying the number of timesteps each prediction is based on, and the number of timesteps that are predicted each time.
